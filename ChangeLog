#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 4.0.0alpha3, 1 Dec 2013
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added rrdtool support, based on code from Alexander Moisseev.

* Fixed BackupPC_attribPrint to auto-detect the compression status of the
  attrib file.  Reported by Chris Adamson.

* Fixed bin/BackupPC_tarExtract for case where no subdirectories are in
  the archive, which caused the top-level attrib file to not be written.
  Reported by Alexander Moisseev.

* Added recovery/cleanup to bin/BackupPC_dump in case last V4 backup is
  not filled.

* Tweaked RmTreeQuietInner() in lib/BackupPC/DirOps.pm to improve error
  messages, and continue on error.

* When FHS is enabled, moved BackupPC.pid and BackupPC.sock files to
  /var/run/BackupPC (or $Conf{RunDir}), and the documentation to
  $InstallDir/share/doc/BackupPC.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 4.0.0alpha2, 15 Sep 2013
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added SCGI support, allowing the Apache to run as any user, with requests
  handled by BackupPC_Admin_SCGI, which is run by the BackupPC server.  This
  provides an alternative to running Apache as the BackupPC user, or needing
  to use a setuid BackupPC_Admin script.

* Parallelized bin/BackupPC_refCountUpdate, so that $Conf{MaxBackupPCNightlyJobs}
  instances run.

* Fixed pool size counting.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 4.0.0alpha1, 30 Jun 2013
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* A few minor bug fixes.

* Some improvements to bin/BackupPC_fsck

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 4.0.0alpha0, 23 Jun 2013
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Major changes.

* Updated init.d/debian-backuppc from Eduardo Díaz Rodríguez.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 3.3.0, 14 Apr 2013
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changed restore file name from restore.{zip|tar} to restore_$host_YYYY-MM-DD.{zip|tar},
  where the date is the start date of the backup.  Originally suggested by Brad Alexander,
  with a healthy debate among Les, Holger, Jeffrey, Adam, Carl and others.

* Changed the timeStamp2 function in lib/BackupPC/CGI/Lib.pm so that times more than 330
  days ago also include the year.  More recent times continue to use just the day of month
  and month.

* Made the directory path display (when browsing backups or history) a sequence of links,
  allowing any parent directory to be quickly selected.

* Added Japanese language file lib/BackupPC/Lang/ja.pm submitted by Rikiya
  Yamamoto.

* Added Ukrainian language file lib/BackupPC/Lang/uk.pm submitted by Serhiy Yakimchuck.

* Added Russian language file lib/BackupPC/Lang/ru.pm submitted by Sergei Butakov.

* Patch from Alexander Moisseev that fixed file name encodings in zip files.
  The default charset is now utf8.  Added a menu option to override the codepage.

* Removed -N option from smbclient command in conf/config.pl to remain compatible
  with more recent versions (3.2.3 and later) of smbclient.  Reported and discussed
  by various people on the mail list, most recently by Jeff Boyce, Les Mikesell and
  Holger Parplies.  Alexander Moisseev also submitted a patch.

  Using smbclient >= 3.2.3 with the -N option will give a "tree connect failed:
  NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED" error.

* Reapplied a patch from Tyler Wagner for lib/BackupPC/CGI/HostInfo.pl so that
  empty email status info doesn't appear.  Somehow this missed 3.2.1.

* Fixed check on $parfile in bin/BackupPC_archiveHost since it is numeric.
  Fix submitted by Tim Massey.

* Ensure $num is numeric in lib/BackupPC/CGI/View.pm error message
  to avoid XSS attack.  Report and patch by Jamie Strandboge.

* Ensure $num and $share in lib/BackupPC/CGI/RestoreFile.pm error messages
  are escaped, to avoid XSS vulnerability.  Report and patch by Jamie Strandboge.
  Also added some additional error checking and tweaked the handling of the
  invalid number error message.

* Fixed qw(...) deprecated syntax warnings in lib/BackupPC/Storage/Text.pm
  and lib/BackupPC/Lib.pm.  Patch supplied by Juergen Harms.  Also got a
  patch from Alexander Moisseev and report from Richard Shaw.

* Fixed error in bin/BackupPC_sendEmail that caused accumulation of
  per-host errors in the admin email to be skipped if a host's user
  is not defined.  Reported by Marco Dalla Via.

* Fixed lib/BackupPC/CGI/RSS.pm so that the base_url is correct for https.
  Report and fix by Samuel Monsarrat.

* Added more careful checking that IO::Dirent returns valid inodes and file types.
  Suggested by Daniel Harvey.

* Removed redundant setting of $Lang{CfgEdit_Title_Other} from all the Lang files.

* Applied couple of fixes to Lib.pm suggested by Jeffrey Kosowsky for special case of where
  configuration commands are fragments of perl code.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 3.2.1, 24 Apr 2011
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Ensure $num is numeric in lib/BackupPC/CGI/Browse.pm to avoid XSS
  attack.  Report and patch by Adam E.

* Fixed application of "*" in $Conf{BackupFilesOnly} and
  $Conf{BackupFilesExclud} for 2nd and later shares.  Reported
  by Alessandro and Alexander Maringer.

* Fixed email status check in lib/BackupPC/CGI/HostInfo.pl so that
  empty email info doesn't appear; reported by Wayne Trevena,
  and based on patch from Tyler Wagner.

* Several fixes to FTP xfer mode related to file excludes, from
  Dave Pearce.

* Wrapped eval() around unpack() in lib/BackupPC/Attrib.pm to avoid
  failures on corrupted attrib files; patch from Tim Connors.

* Applied documention patch from Alexander Moisseev.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 3.2.0, 31 Jul 2010
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed code that detects duplicate shares in bin/BackupPC_dump

* Added fix to lib/BackupPC/Zip/FileMember.pm to avoid bug in
  Archive::Zip 1.30 when creating compressed archives.

* Added Czech translation from Petr Pokorny.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 3.2.0beta1, 24 Jan 2010
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed FTP xfer method, with help from Holger Parplies and
  Mirco Piccin.  FTP restores are still not supported.

* Fixed bug in BackupPC_sendEmail where a user only receives
  email about one host.

* Fixed bug where top-level attrib file was linked into the pool with
  the wrong digest, caused by it being updated multiple times with
  multiple shares.  Reported by Jeff Kosowsky who also supplied a
  patch.

* Fixed bug in blackout calculation when multiple periods span midnight.
  Report and patch from Joachim Falk.

* Wrapped eval {} around attribute unpacking to make it more robust
  to data corruption.  Path submitted by Tim Connors.

* Ignore fileType 8 and 9 in BackupPC_tarCreate rather than consider then
  errors.  These are sockets and unknown (eg: solaris door) files that
  are created dynamicaly by applications - there is no meaningful restore
  for these file types.

* Changed lib/BackupPC/Lib.pm and lib/BackupPC/Storage/Text.pm based on
  patches from Davide Brini and Holger Parplies so that main config
  %Conf values are available in the host config file, allowing more
  flexibility in perl expressions in the config files.  Users beware,
  since the CGI editor won't work correctly if the config file have
  perl expressions.

* Obscure password values in LOG file when CGI editor is used to change
  values.  Proposed by Steve Ling.

* Added favicon.ico from Axel Beckert.  Thanks to Tyler Wagner for submitting
  another version and reminding me about the first.

* Replace "sort(HostSortCompare keys(%$Hosts))" with "sort HostSortCompare keys(%$Hosts)"
  in bin/BackupPC to avoid an error with certain versions of perl.

* Fixed $Conf{XX} links in the BackupPC.html and the CGI editor so they
  correctly reference the definition.

* Support ${VAR} style variable substitution in commands, in addition to
  existing $VAR style.  Suggested by Jeffrey Kosowsky.

* Clarified usage of -b and -w options to BackupPC_tarCreate.  Submitted by
  Michael Selway.

* Repaired Unable_to_connect_to_BackupPC_server Lang string and added new
  string Unable_to_connect_to_BackupPC_server_error_message.  Proposed and
  explained by Holger Parplies.

* Added 'use utf8' to lib/BackupPC/Lang/pl.pm.  Reported by Michal Sawicz.

* Minor updates to lib/BackupPC/Lang/fr.pm from Hubert Tournier.

* Minor update to lib/BackupPC/Lang/en.pm from David Relson.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 3.2.0beta0, 5 April 2009
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added BackupPC::Xfer::Protocol as a common class for each Xfer
  method.  This simplifies some of the xfer specific code.
  Implemented by Paul Mantz.

* Added FTP xfer method, implemented by Paul Mantz.

* Added BackupPC::Xfer module to provide a common interface to the
  different xfer methods.  Implemented by Paul Mantz.

* Moved setting of $bpc->{PoolDir} and $bpc->{CPoolDir} after the
  config file is read in BackupPC::Lib.  Fix proposed by Tim Taylor
  and Joe Krahn, and rediscovered by several others including
  Holger Parplies.

* Create $TopDir and related data directories in BackupPC_dump
  prior to hardlink test.  Requested by Les Stott.

* Fixed encoding of email subject header in bin/BackupPC_sendEmail as
  suggested by Jean-Claude Repetto.  Also changed $Conf{EMailHeaders}
  charset to utf-8.  Also changed bin/BackupPC_sendEmail to not send
  any per-client email if $Conf{BackupsDisable} is set.

* Modified bin/BackupPC_dump to fix the case of a single partial
  backup followed by a successful incremental resulting in a full
  backup of level 1, rather than level 0.  Reported by Jeff
  Kosowsky.

* Fixed BackupPC::PoolWrite to always create the parent directory.
  This fixed a case with rsync/rsyncd where a file like "-i" in the
  top-level directory sorts before ".", which meant the directory
  creation is after the file creation.  Also PoolWrite errors now
  increment xferError count.  Reported by Jeff Kosowsky.

* BackupPC now gives a more useful error message if BackupPC_nightly
  takes more than 24 hours (ie: when the next one is meant to
  start).  Reported by Tony Schreiner.

* Fixed IO::Dirent run-time check.  Reported by Bernhard Ott and Tino Schwarze
  debugged it.

* Added more options to server backup command: rather than just forcing
  an incremental or full backup, a regular (auto) backup can be queued
  (ie: do nothing/incr/full based on schedule), as well as doing just
  an incremental or full or nothing based on the client schedule.
  Based on patches submitted by Joe Digilio.

* Modified lib/BackupPC/CGI/RSS.pm to replace \n with \r\n in the RSS
  http response headers.  Patch submitted by Thomas Eckhardt.

* Modified bin/BackupPC_archive to allow the archive request file
  name to contain spaces and dashes, requested by Tim Massey.

* Fix to configure.pl for --no-fhs case to initialize ConfigDir
  from Dan Pritts.  Also changed perl path to #!/usr/bin/env perl.

* Modified bin/BackupPC_archiveHost to shell escape the output file
  name.  That allows it to contain spaces and other special characters.
  Requested by Toni Van Remortel.  Also updated bin/BackupPC_archiveHost
  to shell escape and check other arguments.

* Added $Conf{CmdQueueNice} to specify nice level for command queue
  commands (eg: BackupPC_link and BackupPC_nightly).  Suggested by
  Carl Soderstrom.

* Added --config-override to configure.pl, allow config settings to be
  set on the command line.  Proposed by Les Stott and Holger Parplies.

* Moved call to NmbLookupFindHostCmd in BackupPC_dump to after the
  check of whether a backup needs to be done.  This makes wakeonlan
  work correctly, rather than waking up the client every WakeupSchedule.
  Reported by David Lasker.

* Improved settings for compression and compext in BackupPC_archiveStart
  based on compression type, as proposed by Paul Dugas.  compext is now
  empty, .gz or .bz2 based on ArchiveComp.

* Changed bin/BackupPC_dump to not ping or lookup the host if
  $Conf{BackupsDisable} is set.  Requested by John Rouillard.

* Changed BackupPC_tarCreate to disable output of final nulls in
  tar archive when -l or -L option is used.  Reported by John
  Rouillard.

* Added error check in BackupPC::Xfer::RsyncFileIO after call to
  BackupPC::Xfer::RsyncDigest->digestStart(), reported by Jeff
  Kosowsky.

* Added variable substitution for host, confDir, client in
  RsyncArgs, and also added option RsyncArgsExtra to allow
  more easy customization of RsyncArgs on a per-client basis.
  Proposed (with patch) by Raman Gupta.

* Added Xfer error column to the host summary table in the CGI
  interface.  Based on patch submitted by Jan Kratochvíl.

* Minor fix to sprintf arguments in BackupPC::Attrib, reported by
  Jonathan Kamens.

* Fixed sort compareLOGName syntax in bin/BackupPC for perl 5.10.x,
  reported by Jeff Kosowsky and Holger Parplies.

* Fixed bin/BackupPC_archiveStart to set compression correctly,
  and also set the file extension to .gz when compression is on.
  Reported by Stephen Vaughan.

* Fixed netbios name comparison in bin/BackupPC_dump and
  bin/BackupPC_restore to just use the first 15 characters
  of the host name.  Patch from Dan MacNeil.

* Fixed nmblookup parsing in BackupPC::Lib::NetBiosInfoGet to ignore
  entries with the <GROUP> tag.  Based on patch from Dan MacNeil.

* Fixed BackupPC_dump so that the XferLOG file is saved when
  DumpPreUserCmd fails.  Reported by John Rouillard.

* Updated BackupPC.pod for $Conf{BackupsDisable}, reported by
  Nils Breunese.

* Added alternate freebsd-backuppc2 init.d script that is
  more compact.  Submitted by Dan Niles.

* Minor updates to lib/BackupPC/Lang/fr.pm from Nicolas STRANSKY
  applied by GFK, and also from Vincent Fleuranceau.

* Minor updates to lib/BackupPC/Lang/de.pm from Klaus Weidenbach.

* Updates to makeDist for command-line setting of version and
  release date from Paul Mantz.

* Add output from Pre/Post commands to per-client LOG file, in addition
  to existing output in the XferLOG file.  Patch from Stuart Teasdale.

* lib/BackupPC/Xfer/Smb.pm now increments xferErrCnt on
  NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED and ERRnoaccess errors from smbclient.
  Reported by Jesús Martel.

* Removed BackupPC_compressPool and BackupPC::Xfer::BackupPCd.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 3.1.0, 25 Nov 2007
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed config editor bug for case where override is unchecked on
  an array where the current array is shorter than the main config's
  array.

* Fixed missing close quote in BackupPC_archiveHost reported by Franky
  Van Liedekerke.

* Replaced "$BinDir/.." with $bpc->InstallDir() for path to BackupPC
  docs, mentioned by Kenneth Porter.

* Moved default of $Conf{IncrLevels} from lib/BackupPC/Storage/Text.pm
  to lib/BackupPC/Lib.pm (after the merge of the config files).  This
  fixes a bug that caused $Conf{IncrLevels} to get over-ridden if it
  was only defined in the main config file. Reported by John Rouillard.

* Fixed the completion status message in BackupPC_dump so that missing
  error counts appear as 0, rather than empty.  Reported by Bill.

* Changed lib/BackupPC/Xfer/RsyncFileIO.pm to only increment the error
  count when the md4 checksum fails on the second phase, not the first.
  Reported by Adrian Bridgett.

* Updated a comment in config.pl about BackupPC_nightly, reported by
  Dan Pritts.

* Modified lib/BackupPC/CGI/Restore.pm to ensure that the list of hosts
  presented for direct restore do have direct restore enabled.  Reported
  by Stephen Joyce.

* Modified lib/BackupPC/CGI/RestoreFile.pm to replace \n with \r\n in
  the restore http response headers.  Patch submitted by Thomas Eckhardt.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 3.1.0beta1, 21 Oct 2007
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* When there is an existing partial, a new partials is only saved
  if it has more files than the existing partial.  Requested by
  Carl Soderstrom.

* Fixed handling of $Conf{BackupFilesExclude} for tar XferMethod.
  Patch supplied by Frans Pop.

* Fixed numeric column sorting in host summary table, reported by
  Michael Pellegrino.

* Fixed host CGI editor so it creates the new host's config.pl file
  using the lower-case host name, since host names are mapped to
  lower case when they are read from the hosts file.  Reported by
  Alexander Onic.

* Applied documentation patches from Frans Pop.  Also updated
  Pod::Html to improve documentation formatting.

* Added Polish translation from Semper.

* Fixed BackupPC_nightly reporting of repeated pool file hashes.

* Add run-time check that IO::Dirent is functioning correctly,
  reported by Doug Lytle.

* Added comment to Cmd settings in conf/config.pl that they are
  not executed by a shell, as suggested by Erik van Linstee.

* Added undefIfEmpty => 1 to lib/BackupPC/Config/Meta.pm for
  RsyncRestoreArgs, TarClientRestoreCmd and SmbClientRestoreCmd
  so that restores can be disabled by clear these fields in the
  CGI editor.  Patch supplied by Stephen Joyce

* Replaced the FAQ link with Wiki in the navigation bar and added
  mention of the Wiki to the documentation.  Since these navigation
  bar links are specified in the config file, upgrades will keep
  the old FAQ link.  The FAQ opening page will have a prominent
  link to the Wiki.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 3.1.0beta0, 3 Sep 2007
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added new script BackupPC_archiveStart that allows command-line
  starting of archives.  Based on script written by Sergey Kovzik,
  which in turn was based on an earlier version by Holger Parplies.

* Added Simplified Chinese CGI translation from Youlin Feng,
  plus fixed a couple of cases where utf8 share names were
  not displayed correctly.

* Added sorting by column feature to host summary table in CGI
  interface.  Implemented by Jeremy Tietsort.

* Added optional support for IO::Dirent which allows inode information
  to be extracted from the dirent directory structure.  This allows
  BackupPC to order some directory operations by inode, which on
  some file systems (eg: ext3) can results in a 20-30% performance
  gain.  On other file systems there is no real improvement.  This
  optimization is turned on automatically if IO::Dirent is installed.

* Added some performance improvements to BackupPC::Xfer::RsyncFileIO
  for the case of small files with cached checksums.

* Added check to BackupPC at startup that $TopDir can support
  hardlinks. Also added check to BackupPC_dump that a hardlink
  below $TopDir/pc/HOST can be made to below $TopDir/cpool.
  Also added the need for a hard-link capable file system to
  the documentation.  Suggested by Nils Breunese.

* Added FreeBSD init.d file provided by Gabriel Rossetti.

* Added -l and -L options to BackupPC_tarCreate so that
  provide a file list (without creating the archive).
  Requested by Dirk.

* Made the default charset for BackupPC_zipCreate cp1252, which
  appears to work correctly with WinZip.  Unfortunately there is
  no clear standard for charset encoding in zip files.

* Added support so that pre-3.0 backups with non-utf8 charsets
  can be viewed and restored correctly.  A new config variable
  $Conf{ClientCharsetLegacy} specifies the charset used to
  encode file names in legacy backups.  This is only relevant
  if you are trying to view or restore a backup made with
  BackupPC 2.x and some of the file names have non-ascii
  characters.

* Added setting of the environment variable BPC_REQUSER to
  the requesting user name in BackupPC prior to fork(), so
  each child process inherits the value.  Submitted by
  Holger Parplies.

* Fixed bug in rsync incrementals that happens on particular
  file names when a file being backed up fails in both rsync
  phases.  Reported by Dan Smisko.

* Fixed single-restore file name charsets for IE, reported by
  Francis Lessard.

* Fixed makeDist so that the --config-dir option to configure.pl
  works correctly.  Reported by Randy Barlow, Tony Shadwick and others.

* Removed ConfDir from config editor (since it is hardcoded in
  lib/BackupPC/Lib.pm).  Also made TopDir and LogDir only visible
  if useFHS (for non-FHS they are hardcoded in lib/BackupPC/Lib.pm).

* Applied patch from Holger Parplies that fixes cleanup of early abort
  in BackupPC_dump.

* Applied small patch from Sergey to lib/BackupPC/Xfer/Tar.pm that makes
  it ignore "socket ignored" error on incrementals.

* Applied small patch from Sergey to bin/BackupPC_archiveHost.

* Changed BackupPC_sendEmail so that summary admin email doesn't
  include errors from hosts that have $Conf{BackupsDisable} set.
  Reported by James Kyle.  Also, per-user email is now disabled
  when $Conf{BackupsDisable} is set.

* Added RsyncdUserName to the config editor.  Reported by Vicent Roca Daniel.

* $Conf{IncrLevels} is now defaulted if it is not defined.

* configure.pl clears $Conf{ParPath} if it doesn't point to a valid
  executable.

* Added documentation for BackupPC_tarPCCopy, including use of -P option
  to tar suggested by Daniel Berteaud.

* Config editor now removes white space at start of exec path.
  Reported by Christoph Iwasjuta.

* CgiDateFormatMMDD == 2 gives a YYYY-MM-DD format for CGI dates,
  suggested by Imre.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 3.0.0, 28 Jan 2007
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BackupPC_sendEmail now correctly sends admin email if backups
  were skipped because the disk was too full, reported by Dan
  Pritts.

* BackupPC_Admin now uses $Conf{UmaskMode}, so config.pl files
  written by the editor have more restrictive permissions.
  Reported by Tim Massey.

* Host summary now shows active backups on disabled hosts,
  from Jono Woodhouse.

* Fixed host LOG link and LOG list order, reported by Tim Massey.

* Moved Encode.pm version check to start of configure.pl so it
  produces a useful error message if Encode.pm is too old.

* Fixed hrefs to configuration documentation to handle changes
  in the way perl generates the anchors.  Reported by Philip
  Gleghorn.

* Host name links in LOG files now allow "." in the host name.
  Reported by Jean-Michel Beuken.

* Fixes to lib/BackupPC/Xfer/Tar.pm for tar 1.16: allow 1
  (ie: 256) as a successful exit status and match "Total
  bytes read" message for restores.  First reported by
  Torsten Sadowski and debugged by Ralf Gross and Holger
  Parplies.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 3.0.0beta3, 3 Dec 2006
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Removed default paths from conf/config.pl so configure.pl will
  determine the correct ones at install time.  Avoids problem of
  the config editor complaining about bad executable paths the
  first time you use it.

* Changed first byte of compressed files with rsync checksums appended
  to 0xd7 to allow correct protocol_version >= 27 md4 checksums to be
  written.  Old cached checksum files have a first byte 0xd6 and are
  now considered to be uncached.  They will be automatically updated
  as needed.  This avoids the cached checksum warnings in beta2.

* BackupPC_tarPCCopy now handles all file types correctly.  Reported
  by George Avrunin.

* Fixed BackupPC_nightly to finish pending deletes before renaming
  pool chains.

* Fixes for rsync restore where hardlink is to file outside of the
  top-level restore directory.  Reported by George Avrunin, who helped
  with debugging.

* Fixes for checksum mismatch on restore for certain file sizes.
  Reported by George Avrunin and others.

* Fix for config.pl writing code to handle multi-line expressions.
  Reported by David Relson and others.

* Fix for CGI editor when deleting hash entries whose keys are
  non alphanumeric.  Report by David Relson and Aaron Ciarlotta.

* Two fixes to configure.pl from Andreas Vögele.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 3.0.0beta2, 18 Nov 2006
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix for final md4 digest check on rsync transfers >= 512MB when protocol
  version >= 27 and checksums are not cached.  Reported by Garith Dugmore
  and Dale Renton.

* Config Editor "Save" button is now always visible, but greyed out
  until there are changes to save.

* Config editor allows other tabs to be selected when there is an
  error, which allows you to fix an error (eg: missing binary) in
  an exiting config file.  Errors are now displayed at the top of
  the page in addition to next to the erroneous setting.

* configure.pl checks version of Encode.pm.  Reported by Chris Stone.

* Several fixes to bin/BackupPC_fixupBackupSummary from Stian Jordet.

* Fixed config.pl editor writing to solve bug with multi-line text
  strings ending in newline.  Reported and root caused by Les Stott
  and Jerry Groendyke.

* Fixed error recovery case in BackupPC::PoolWrite, reported by
  Samuel Bancal.

* Fixed table width in backup browsing to avoid Firefox layout anomoly,
  provided by Jono Woodhouse.

* CSS file updates from Jono Woodhouse.  Prior (v2) version is included
  as BackupPC_stnd_orig.css in case people prefer the old skin.

* More compact host summary, including disabled host indication,
  from Jono Woodhouse.

* New directory/file/hardlink and symlink image icons from Sean Cameron
  and Jono Woodhouse, making directory browse more compact.

* BackupPC.pid is now world readable, suggested by Casper Thomsen.

* Reordered the Server navigation bar links, suggested by David Relson.

* Fixed typos in init.d/src/gentoo-backuppc, configure.pl and config.pl
  reported by David Relson.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 3.0.0beta1, 30 Jul 2006
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed several Xfer charset conversions.

* Added some CGI utf8 conversions from Rodrigo Real and Vincent
  Fleuranceau.

* Rsync transfers now correctly handle file names with \n or \r.

* Host name is forced to lower case, to match 2.x.

* Fixed LOG file naming in BackupPC_restore and BackupPC_archive.

* GFK applied fr.pm corrections from Nicolas Stransky.

* Updated init.d/src scripts for FHS (ie: replaced __TOPDIR__/log
  with __LOGDIR__ and __TOPDIR__/conf with __CONFDIR__).  Patch
  provided by Rodrigo Real.

* Added --log-dir and --conf-dir options to configure.pl.
  Reported by Vincent Fleuranceau.

* Updated File::RsyncP version check in configure.pl, reported
  by Vincent Fleuranceau.  Changed File::RsyncP version to 0.64.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 3.0.0beta0, 11 Jul 2006
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added configuration and host CGI editor.

* Added rsync hardlink support.  Requires latest version of
  File::RsyncP (0.62).

* Decoupled BackupPC_dump from BackupPC_nightly by making
  asynchronous file linking/delete robust to race conditions.
  Now only BackupPC_nightly and BackupPC_link are mutually
  exclusive so only one runs at a time, and BackupPC_dump and
  BackupPC_restore can run anytime.

* Added support for multi-level incrementals.  In the style of dump(1),
  the level of each incremental can be specified.  Each incremental
  backups up everything since the most recent backup of a lower level
  (fulls are always level 0).  Previous behavior was all incrementals
  were level 1, meaning they backed up everything since the last full
  (level 0).  Default configuration is all incrementals are level 1.

* Server file names are now in utf8 and optional conversion
  to/from client name charsets can be configured.  All CGI pages
  now use the utf8 charset.

* Backup metadata is now additionally saved to pc/HOST/nnn/backupInfo,
  in addition to pc/HOST/backups.  In case pc/HOST/backups gets trashed,
  then a new script BackupPC_fixupBackupSummary can read the per-backup
  metadata from pc/HOST/nnn/backupInfo and reconstruct the backups file.
  Roberto Moreno also pointed out an early error in the CVS version.

* Added Storage module and Storage::Text which localizes all the
  text data file reading/writing (eg: backups, restores, archives
  and config.pl files).  Added read verify after all write
  operations for robustness.  Additional backends (eg: SQL)
  can be added in the future as new subclasses of the Storage
  module.

* Added Config module, and Config::Meta that contains meta data
  about configuration parameters.

* Added RSS support from Rich Duzenbury.

* Translations of new 3.0 language strings from Guillaume Filion,
  Reginaldo Ferreira, Ralph Passgang, Lieven Bridts, Guus Houtzager,
  Rodrigo Real.

* Added optional checking of exit status of Dump/Restore/Archive Pre/Post
  UserCmd, requested by Kiko Jover, Matthias Bertschy and others.

* For new installations configure.pl tries to comply with the file
  system hierarchy standard, which means all the configuration files
  below /etc/BackupPC and log files go below /var/log/BackupPC.

* Added Slackware init.d script from Tony Nelson.

* Fixed error reporting when restore/archive fail to write the
  request file to the client directory.

* Applied patch from Marc Prewitt for DumpPreShareCmd and DumpPostShareCmd.

* Apply patch from Pete Wenzel to add smbClientPath => $Conf{SmbClientPath}
  to DumpPreUserCmd etc.

* Added Portuguese Brazillian pt_br.pm from Reginaldo Ferreira.

* Jean-Michel Beuken reported several bugs in configure.pl in CVS 3.0.0.

* Old backup email warnings now ignore partials requested by Samuel Bancal

* Applied patch to bin/BackupPC_sendEmail from Marc Prewitt that
  ignores any file starting with "." in the pc directory when
  it is generating warnings about old/unused files/directories.

* Applied patch from Marc Prewitt to fix host queue order.
 
* Applied Lorenzo Cappelletti's it.pm patch.

* Applied Wander Winkelhorst's nl.pm patch.

* Applied Alberto Marconi's it.pm patch.

* Add NT_STATUS_FILE_LOCK_CONFLICT to pst read error check in
  BackupPC_sendEmail to fix bug reported by Dale Renton.

* Added fixup of $ENV{REMOTE_USER} to lib/BackupPC/CGI/Lib.pm in the
  case of using mod_authz_ldap; patch submitted by Alain Perrier.

* Added env LC_ALL=C to $Conf{TarClientCmd} and $Conf{TarClientRestoreCmd}
  to avoid locale problems, suggested by Ludovic Drolez.

* Changed ping output parsing to pick out average rtt time, based
  on patch from Ron Bickers.

* Removed leading "./" and top-level "./" directory from
  zip archives generated by BackupPC_zipCreate.  Reported
  by Josh (hecktarzuli).

* BackupPC_tarCreate and BackupPC_zipCreate now allow "@"
  in share names.  Reported by Robert Waldner.

* NT_STATUS_INSUFF_SERVER_RESOURCES is now a fatal error for
  smbclient transfers, suggested by Brian Shand.

* Changed bin/BackupPC_archiveHost to use /bin/csh instead of
  /bin/sh.  That way any errors in the pipeline are reported
  via the exit status, instead of just the last.

* Added $Conf{EMailHeaders} for additional email headers, requested
  by Ludovic Gasc.  If the Content-Type charset is set to utf8 then
  the body of the email is sent in utf8 coding.

* Made shareName argument regexp checking more general to allow parens.

* Added some debian init.d instructions to init.d/README from
  Bob de Wildt.

* Documentation updates from Richard Ames, JP Vossen, Torsten Finke.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 2.1.2pl2, 18 Jun 2006
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* In conf/config.pl, changed --devices to -D in $Conf{RsyncArgs}
  and $Conf{RsyncRestoreArgs} to fix "fileListReceive failed" and
  "Can't open .../f%2f for empty output" errors with rsync 2.6.7+.
  Fix proposed by Justin Pessa and Vincent Ho, and confirmed by
  Dan Niles.

* Added patch from Michael (mna.news) to ignore "file is unchanged"
  message from tar 1.15.x during incremental backups.

* Fixed creation of .rsrc directories in bin/BackupPC_tarExtract
  when used with xtar on MacOS.  Reported by Samuel Bancal and
  Matthew Radey, who helped with debugging.

* Fixed bug in BackupPC_tarExtract for files >8GB in size whose
  lengths are multiples of 256.  Reported by Jamie Myers and
  Marko Tukiainen, who both helped debugging the problem.

* Fixed bug in lib/BackupPC/Xfer/RsyncFileIO.pm that caused
  incorrectly deleted attributes to be set in directories
  where one of the files had an rsync phase 1 retry during
  an incremental.  Reported by Tony Nelson.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 2.1.2, 5 Sep 2005
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed simple but serious bug in bin/BackupPC_tarCreate that prevented
  hardlinks being saved correctly.  Debugged by Michael (mna.news)
  with several other people.

* Fixed serious bug in bin/BackupPC_dump reported/debugged by Dan Niles
  that can happen when multiple full backups are deleted after
  $Conf{FullKeepCnt} is changed.

* Changed lib/BackupPC/CGI/Lib.pm so that link to "$TopDir/conf/$host.pl"
  is displayed if it exists.  Patch from Andreas Vögele.

* Applied daemonize patch to bin/BackupPC from:
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=301057

* It's now a fatal error if $Conf{CompressLevel} is set, but
  Compress::Zlib is not found.  Before $Conf{CompressLevel} was
  silently set to 0, which made all the backups uncompressed.
  That meant the user never knew if they forget to install
  Compress::Zlib but were expecting compression to be on.

* Finally increased $Conf{ClientTimeout} to 72000 (20 hours).

* Added sleep 1 in restart() function in init.d/src/gentoo-backuppc,
  suggested by Jon Hood.

* Added $DestDir to the path of the CGI image directory in configure.pl.
  Patch submitted by Andreas Vögele.

* Applied extensive patch to French translation from Frederic Lehobey.

* Minor change to Dutch language $Lang{Pool_Stat} from Wander Winkelhorst.

* Minor change to French language $Lang{EMailOutlookBackupMesg} and
  $Lang{EMailOutlookBackupSubj} from Ludovic Gasc.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 2.1.1, 13 Mar 2005
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Fixed bug in top-level restore using rsync XferMethod.
   BackupPC::View was leaving an extra leading "/" at the start
   of top-level directories, messing up the FileList sort order.
   Reported and debugged by Gail Edwards.

 * Added pathCreate() to BackupPC_tarExtract so that new directories
   are created.  Required for xtar on MacOSX since the virtual resource
   fork directories (.rsrc) are not explicitly included in the tar
   archive - just the files below .rsrc are.

 * Changed $host.$bkupNum.tar$fileExt.* to $host.$bkupNum.tar$fileExt*
   in $parCmd in bin/BackupPC_archiveHost.

 * Fixed HostSortCompare() in BackupPC to correctly sort hosts so
   those with the oldest backups get queued first.

 * Changed test in BackupPC_sendEmail so that directories/files
   starting with "." in $TopDir/pc are ignored, rather than
   just "." and "..".

 * Changed BackupPC_sendEmail to include NT_STATUS_FILE_LOCK_CONFLICT
   in check for bad outlook files.

 * Ensure that %Status and %StatusHost are empty if requesting
   status on hosts in lib/BackupPC/CGI/Lib.pm GetStatusInfo().
   Fixes problem with new hosts under mod_perl.

 * Added images/icon-hardlink.gif so that hardlinks show file type icon.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 2.1.0pl1, 15 Aug 2004
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added fix to nl.pm from Lieven Bridts.

* Added patch from Tony Nelson to remove $Info{pid} before BackupPC
  writes the status and shuts down.

* Changed BackupPC_nightly so that it doesn't call find() if the
  directory doesn't exist.  This avoids errors in certain versions
  of perl.  Reported by Bernd Rilling.

* Fixed BackupPC::CGI::Lib to correctly re-load config.pl for mod_perl.
  Reported by Tony Nelson and Jimmy Liang.

* Explicitly untaint $In{host} in BackupPC::CGI::Lib to fix problem
  reported by Thomas Tempé.

* Added newline to "...skipping because of user requested delay..."
  log message in BackupPC_dump.  Reported by Wayne Scott.

* Added read file size error checking to BackupPC_tarCreate.
  Reported by Brandon Evans.

* Added check in BackupPC::Xfer::RsyncFileIO to ensure that when
  compression is toggled on/off, a compressed backup doesn't link
  to an uncompressed pool file (and an uncompressed backup doesn't
  link to a compressed pool file).  Reported by Brandon Evans.

* Updated documentation with new dirvish URL and a typo from
  Todd Curry.

* Fix to BackupPC_sendEmail so that it correctly sends admin emails
  for hosts that have failed backups.  Reported by Simon Kuhn.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 2.1.0, 20 Jun 2004
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added Dutch translation from Lieven Bridts, with tweaks from
  Guus Houtzager.

* Added PC-specific config file read in CGI/Archive.pm.  Patch
  from Pete Wenzel.

* Added non-zero exit code to BackupPC_zcat when uncompress fails.
  Patch from Pete Wenzel.

* Cosmetic changes to PC Summary and Log file language strings from
  Pete Wenzel.

* BackupPC::Lib tries to be more careful when renaming the backups
  file to backups.old.  There have been reports of backups being
  empty, perhaps when the BackupPC data file system fills up.
  Now backups is not renamed to backups.old if backups is empty.

* BackupPC now closes stderr and stdout before renaming and
  re-opening the log file.

* Pre/post backup/restore/archive commands now correctly set
  "type" to either incr/full/restore/archive, and now cmdType
  is the type of Pre/post backup/restore/archive command.

* BackupPC_archive correctly terminates archive processes on
  alarm or cancel.

* Updates to BackupPC_stnd.css with absolute font sizes instead
  of relative.

* BackupPC_dump now makes sure that the $Conf{FullAgeMax} check
  also ensures the full backup is older than the maximum age
  expected from $Conf{FullPeriod}.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 2.1.0beta2pl1, 30 May 2004
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed bug in rsync checksum caching code in BackupPC::Xfer::RsyncDigest.

* BackupPC_zipCreate now ensures the earliest mtime is 1/1/1980,
  since zip file formats don't support earlier dates.  Reported
  by Dan Niles.

* CGI restore via zip and tar now makes sure stderr is ignored
  when BackupPC_tarCreate and BackupPC_zipCreate are run.
  Previously any stderr output would get mixed in the archive,
  corrupting it.  Reported by Dan Niles.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 2.1.0beta2, 23 May 2004
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* $Conf{BackupFilesOnly} and $Conf{BackupFilesExclude} now apply
  to every share, rather than just the first, in the case where
  they are arrays and there are multiple shares.  Suggested
  by Andy Evans.

* On the phase 2 retry pass with rsync, verify the cached checksums
  if checksum caching is turned on.  This will catch the case of
  cached checksums being incorrectly appended to the compressed
  pool file.  Added new config parameter $Conf{RsyncCsumCacheVerifyProb}
  so that cached checksums are verified with a selectable probability.
  Also, increased File::RsyncP version number to 0.51.

* configure.pl now supports an optional batch mode.  Command-line
  options are used to specify all the information that configure.pl
  needs.  This is useful for building auto-install packages.
  Also, configure.pl now includes pod documentation, so you can do
  "perldoc configure.pl" to see all the command-line options.
  Suggested, tested and tweaked by Stuart Herbert for possible
  Gentoo inclusion.

* At each wakeup, clients are now queued based on how old the most
  recent backup is.  Clients with errors are queued first, with
  the oldest error times going first.  The rest of the clients are
  queued next, with the clients with the oldest backup going first.
  Previously the clients were simply queued in alphabetic order.
  Suggested by Mike Trisko and Tony Nelson.

* Added config parameter $Conf{PartialAgeMax} that controls whether
  partials are saved at all, and if so, whether the partial will be
  ignored at the next full backup if it is too old.

* BackupPC_tarExtract now allows empty archives without reporting
  an error.  Reported by Don Silvia.

* Removed Browse Backups link from Nav Bar in Archive Info display.
  Reported by Ralph Paßgang.

* Fixed documentation display for regular users.  Reported by Ralph Paßgang.

* Status and PC Summary now work for regular users and only show
  that user's hosts.  Server general status information only appears
  for admins.  Suggested by Ralph Paßgang.

* Moved the last three navigation-bar links (docs, FAQ and SF) to
  a new config parameter $Conf{CgiNavBarLinks}.  This allows
  these links to be locally configured.  Based on a patch
  submitted by Ralph Paßgang.

* Allow the navigation bar search box to be disabled by
  setting $Conf{CgiSearchBoxEnable} to 0.  Based on a patch
  submitted by Ralph Paßgang.

* Updates to de.pm from Ralph Paßgang.

* Made the BackupPC icon a link to the SF BackupPC project page.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 2.1.0beta1, 4 Apr 2004
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The CSS definition has been removed from the config.pl file and
  is now a separate file, BackupPC_stnd.css.  A new config variable,
  $Conf{CgiCSSFile}, gives the name of the CSS file to use.
  Suggested by Ender Mathias.

* Fixed the filling of the host name select box for admins.
  The default $Conf{CgiNavBarAdminAllHosts} is now 1.
  Reported by Doug Lytle.

* Cleaned up warning message for restore using rsync when checksum
  caching is on, but when file didn't have cached checksums.

* Fixed BackupPC_archiveHost to support par2 (par2cmdline).
  Patch submitted by Jaco Bongers and adapted by Josh Marshall.

* Improved stat() usage in BackupPC_nightly, plus some other cleanup,
  giving a significant performance improvement.  Patch submitted by
  Wayne Scott.

* Allow several BackupPC_nightly processes to run in parallel based
  on new $Conf{BackupPCNightlyJobs} setting.  This speeds up the
  traversal of the pool, reducing the overall run time for
  BackupPC_nightly.

* Allow BackupPC_nightly to split the pool traversal across several
  nightly runs.  This improves the running time per night, at the expense
  of a slight increase in disk storage as unused pool files might not
  be deleted for a couple of days.  Controller by new config setting
  $Conf{BackupPCNightlyPeriod}.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 2.1.0beta0, 20 Mar 2004
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* A failed full dump is now saved as a partial (incomplete) dump,
  provided it includes some files.  This can be used for browsing,
  restoring etc, and will also form the basis of resuming full
  dumps.  Only one partial is kept, and it is removed as soon
  as a successful full (or a new partial) is done.

* Added support for resuming a full dump for rsync.  The partial
  full is kept, and to resume an incremental is done against the
  partial, and a full is done for the rest.

* Added support for Rsync checksum caching.  Rsync checksum are
  appended to the compressed pool files.  This means that block
  and file checksums do not need to be recomputed on the server
  when using rsync.  Requires a patch to rsync to support fixed
  checksum seeds.  This patch is included in the cygwin-rsyncd
  release on http://backuppc.sourceforge.net.

* Major addition of Archive feature from Josh Marshall.  Special
  clients can be configured to be archive targets (eg: tape drives,
  CD-R).  Any subset of the backup clients can be selected and tar
  archives are created, optionally compressed and split and written
  to the output device.  Logs are maintained and are browsable.

* Major changes from Ryan Kucera to add style sheets to the CGI
  interface, allowing easy customization.  Added new icons and
  BackupPC logo.  Numerous navigation improvements.

* Added directory history display to BackupPC_Admin, allowing the
  user to quickly see which files changed between backups on a
  per-directory basis.

* Added exponential expiry option for full dumps.  This allows you
  to specify
  
   - how many fulls to keep at intervals of $Conf{FullPeriod}, followed by
   - how many fulls to keep at intervals of 2 * $Conf{FullPeriod},
   - how many fulls to keep at intervals of 4 * $Conf{FullPeriod},
   - how many fulls to keep at intervals of 8 * $Conf{FullPeriod},
   - how many fulls to keep at intervals of 16 * $Conf{FullPeriod},

  and so on.  This allows you, for example, to keep 4 weekly fulls,
  followed by 6 fulls every 4 weeks (approx 1 month) and 2 fulls at
  16 weeks, for roughly 1 year of history.  This works by deleting
  every other full as each expiry boundary is crossed.  Suggested
  by David Cramblett.

* Added Italian language translation it.pm from Lorenzo Cappelletti.

* Major updates to language files for new features and tags changes.
  Updated makeDist to do pedantic consistency checking of language
  files.

* Addition of administration options from Paul Lukins.  Initial
  page allows server to be started/stopped/reloaded.  This still
  needs some i18n work.  Currently the server start/stop is
  commented out.

* Split BackupPC_Admin into a set of modules, one for each major action.
  Each action is now a seperate module in lib/BackupPC/CGI.

* Allow the blackout period begin/end to span midnight.  Adapted
  from patch submitted by David Smith.

* Allow multiple blackout periods, with new config variable
  $Conf{BlackoutPeriods} that replaces the old variables
  $Conf{BlackoutHourBegin}, $Conf{BlackoutHourEnd}, and
  $Conf{BlackoutWeekDays}.  Based on patch submitted by
  Lorenzo Cappelletti.

* Disabled alarms after forks to avoid timeouts in children that
  do not reset their alarm.  Prompted by ideas from James Leu.

* Added options for block size, buffer size and share wild-card to
  BackupPC_tarCreate.  Also added negative backup number options
  that are relative to the last (so -1 is the last), suggested by
  William McKee and Carl Soderstrom.

* The "Wrong user" message in BackupPC::Lib now goes to stderr, so that
  the user is more likely to see the error with BackupPC_tarCreate.
  Reported by Paul Fox.

* Add creation of per-PC directory in BackupPC/CGI/Restore.pm in
  case it doesn't already exist.

* Added -q -x to all ssh commands in conf/config.pl.  Suggested by
  SI Reasoning and Niranjan Ghate.

* Changed restore code so that option #1 (direct restore) can be
  disabled if the restore command is undefined.  Disabling direct
  restore is necessary if the share is read-only.  Suggested by
  Rich B from SAIC.

* Changed regexp in lib/BackupPC/Smb.pm to allow numbers with both
  a decimal point or comma for international versions of Samba.
  Patch submitted by Frank Gard.

* Browsing and directory history now sort the files in a
  case-insensitive manner.

* Changed exec() syntax to allow executing commands whose path
  contains spaces.

* BackupPC_dump no longer removes backups if $Conf{FullKeepCnt}
  is zero or undefined.  The protects the existing backups in the
  case of a bad config.pl file.  Suggested by Christian Warden.

* Swapped the Server and Hosts sections on the Nav bar.  Moved the
  host search text box to the top of the hosts section.  This was
  done to move the variable-length part of the Nav bar (when all
  hosts are displayed) to the bottom.

* Fixed a bug in tar restore related to how the common prefix path is
  removed.  Now ensure that the common path is at a directory boundary.
  Reported by Patrick Neuner.

* Added --chuid ${USER} to init.d/src/gentoo-backuppc.  Suggested by
  SI Reasoning, Pascal Pochol, Michael Evanoff and others.

* Added Suse notes to init.d/README from Bruno Vernay.

* Added Apache 2 documentation fix from Michael Tuzi.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 2.0.2, 6 Oct 2003
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed stupid last-minute change in octal size conversion in
  Backup_tarExtract.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 2.0.1, 5 Oct 2003
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed handling of >= 8GB files in BackupPC_tarExtract and >= 4GB
  files in BackupPC_tarCreate.

* Removed smbclient size repair in BackupPC_tarExtract for files
  between 2GB and 4GB.  This means that BackupPC_tarExtract 2.0.1
  doesn't behave the same as 2.0.0 for file sizes between 2GB and 4GB
  extacted using smbclient 2.2.x.  If you have problems backing up
  files whose size is between 2GB and 4GB using smbclient 2.2.x
  you should upgrade smbclient to 3.0, since it now generates
  correct file sizes.

* Replace PingClientPath with PingPath in configure.pl.

* Removed -T (taint mode) on binaries installed in configure.pl.

* Added support for smbclient from samba version 3.0.0.

* Fixed $Conf{HardLinkMax} limit check in BackupPC::Lib; reported
  by Ross Skaliotis.

* In BackupPC_Admin, default REMOTE_USER to $Conf{BackupPCUser}
  if it is not defined.  This allows the CGI interface to work
  when AdminUsers = '*'.  Reported by Quentin Arce.

* For SMB, code that detected files with a read-locked region (eg:
  outlook .pst files), removed them and then tried to link with an
  earlier version was broken.  This code missed a step of mangling
  the file names.  This is now fixed.  Reported by Pierre Bourgin.

* A backup of a share that has zero files is now considered
  fatal. This is used to catch miscellaneous Xfer errors that
  result in no files being backed up.  A new config parameter
  $Conf{BackupZeroFilesIsFatal} (defaults to 1) and can be set to
  zero to turn off this check.  Suggested by Guillaume Filion.
  Additional change: this check only applies to a full dump.

* SMB: now detect NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED on entire share or BackupFilesOnly
  (also ERRDOS - ERRnoaccess (Access denied.) for older versions of
  smbclient.)  Suggested by Guillaume Filion.

* SMB: now detects "tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME" and
  the dump is considered failed.

* Rsync: Previously BackupFilesOnly = '/' did --include '/' --exclude '/*',
  which just included the '/' directory and nothing below.  Now it
  does just --include '/', which should include everything.
  Reported by denon.

* Add hostError to DumpPostUserCmd variable substitutions for both dump
  and restore.

* Verbose output in Lib.pm goes to STDERR, not STDOUT.  This now
  makes BackupPC_dump -v work better.

* Don't allow browsing with ".." in directory in case a user tries
  to trick BackupPC_Admin into displaying directories outside where
  they are allowed.

* Required File::RsyncP version is now 0.44, since File::RsyncP 0.44
  fixes large file (>2GB) bugs.  Large file bugs reported by Steve
  Waltner.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 2.0.0, 14 Jun 2003
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Minor tweaks to disable utf8 on utf8-capable machines (eg: RH8+).
  Added "no utf8" to all programs, and added binmode() to relevant
  file handles.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 2.0.0beta3, 1 Jun 2003
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Several improvements to restore: cancel now reports the correct
  message and cleans up correctly.

* Rsync with whitespace and wildcard excludes fixed by replacing
  argList with argList+ in config.pl plus a fix to Lib.pm for
  shell escaping array arguments.

* Fixed rsync restore for character and block special devices
  (major and minor device numbers weren't correctly restored).

* Fixed typo in bin/BackupPC_restore (XferLOG -> RestoreLOG).

* (Re)-fixed "Bad command" in log file when restore via tar or zip
  file download is done.

* Added untaint to exec in Lib.pm to avoid tainted errors.

* Applied additional tweak to hilight patch from Tim Demarest.

* $Conf{CgiAdminUsers} = '*' now allows privileged even with REMOTE_USER
  not set.

* Don't display RsyncdPasswd when displaying config.pl files.

* Replace pipe with socketpair in bin/BackupPC_dump and bin/BackupPC_restore,
  which increases typical buffering from 4K to 16K-64K.  This improves the
  performance.

* Add check on $ENV{LANG} setting do configure.pl: if LANG includes utf
  then a warning is printed.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 2.0.0beta2, 11 May 2003
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added German translation, provided by Manfred Herrmann.

* Fixed large-file problem with rsync, reported by Manfred Herrmann.

* Fixed zip and tar file download from CGI under mod_perl.  Reported
  by Pierre Bourgin and Paul Lukins.

* Fixed directory browsing and top-level directory browsing in 2.0.0beta0.
  Reported by several users.

* Added -v option to BackupPC_dump for verbose output (useful when
  you run the command manually).  Added messages for all exits.

* If nmblookup returns multiple IP addresses, NetBiosHostIPFind()
  now returns the first IP address that matches the subnet mask.
  Suggested by Tim Demarest.

* Fixed BackupPC::View so the top-level directory is handled correctly.
  This allows the top-level share/directory to be restored via the
  CGI interface.  Reported by several users.

* Fixed RsyncFileIO failures on certain large files by replacing seek()
  with sysseek().  Reported by Manfred Herrmann.

* Added configurable highlighting of PC status in the CGI summary
  screen; submitted by Tim Demarest.

* Fixed command queue CGI display; submitted by Tim Demarest.

* BackupPC_trashClean now logs an error if it can't remove all the
  trash and then goes back to sleep, rather than continually trying.

* Moved correct user (uid) check into BackupPC::Lib so that all
  applications do a user check if $Cong{BackupPCUserVerify} is
  set.  The avoids the risk of manually running BackupPC_dump as
  the wrong user.

* Loss of blackout now applies to "host not found" as well as no ping.
  Reported by Dale Renton.

* "Host not found" is now treated in a similar manner to "no ping".

* Added suse-linux init.d script from Leon Letto.

* Added Gentoo linux init.d script from Tim Demarest.

* Applied additional i18n strings from GFK and the translation team.

* Fixed option parsing so that getopts errors are reported and we exit.

* Changed reporting of Xfer PIDs so that rsync cancel works correctly.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 2.0.0beta1, 30 Mar 2003
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added Spanish translation es.pm from Javier Gonzalez.

* Fixed CGI browse navigation bug that causes BackupPC_Admin to wedge
  when directories were selected in a certain order.

* Fixed BackupPC::PoolWrite so that it can recover when the initial
  file size is wrong.  This is needed since rsync could write a file
  whose size is different from the initial size returned in the
  file list when that file is updated while rsync is running.

* Added binmode(STDIN) to BackupPC_tarExtract, suggested by Pat LoPresti
  to fix a problem a RedHat8 with perl 5.8.0.  It's unclear why this
  helps, but it should be benign.  See:
    http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1853018&forum_id=503

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 2.0.0beta0, 23 Feb 2003
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Support for rsync and rsyncd backup and restore.  Changes to
  BackupPC_dump, BackupPC_restore, and new modules BackupPC::Xfer::Rsync
  and BackupPC::Xfer::RsyncFileIO.

* Added internationalization (i18n) code from Xavier Nicollet,
  with additions from Guillaume Filion.  Voila!  BackupPC_Admin
  now supports English and French, and adding more languages is
  now easy.  New config paramater $Conf{Language} sets the language.

* Added optional user-defined pre/post dump/restore commands, allowing
  things like database shutdown/startup for dumps.

* Changed the way hosts are found.

* Added $Conf{ClientNameAlias}, which allows the name of the physical
  client machine to be set.  This allows several different backup
  "hosts" to all refer to the same physical machine, which is
  convenient if several different types of data need to be backed
  up, or if different parameters are needed for different parts of
  the host.

* Replaced $Conf{PingArgs} with $Conf{PingCmd}, added $Conf{DfCmd},
  $Conf{NmbLookupCmd} allowing all these commands to be fully
  configured.  Also, all commands can also now be fragments of
  perl code.

* Moved all smbclient commands into the config.pl file so the specific
  arguments can be customized.  New config parameters are
  $Conf{SmbClientFullCmd}, $Conf{SmbClientIncrCmd} and
  $Conf{SmbClientRestoreCmd}.

* Added new BackupPC::View module that creates views of backups
  (handling merging etc).  Updated BackupPC_Admin, BackupPC_zipCreate
  and BackupPC_tarCreate to use BackupPC::View.  This removes lots
  of merging and mangling code from the higher-level code.

* Added code from Toby Johnson that allows additional users to be
  specified in the hosts file; these users can also view/start/stop
  and restore backups for that host.  Also added a new config
  setting $Conf{CgiNavBarAdminAllHosts} that allows all hosts to
  be listed in the left nav bar for admins.

* Added $Conf{HardLinkMax} (default 31999) which sets the limit on
  the maximum number of hardlinks per file in the pool.  If a file
  ever gets to this number of links a new pool file is created to
  handle additional links.

* Added $Conf{PerlModuleLoad}, which allows optional additional perl
  modules to be loaded.

* Added $Conf{EMailUserDestDomain} and other EMail config settings to
  allow language-specific default messages to be overridden.

* Added BPC_FTYPE_DELETED to lib/BackupPC/Attrib.pm, allowing deleted
  files to be represented in the attrib file correctly.

* Added support for environment variable BPC_SMB_PASSWD, which is the
  client's smb password.  This overrides the old environment variable
  PASSWD.

* Added taint cleanup for perl5.8 to lib/BackupPC/Lib.pm.

* Changed $tar_unpack_header format in BackupPC_tarExtract to correctly
  handle files with trailing spaces.

* Added catching of SIG_PIPE to BackupPC_dump, and changed catch_signal
  to ignore multiple signals of the same type.

* Added reporting of the largest number of hardlinks in the pool to the
  log file.

* Adding reporting of syntax errors in the per-PC config.pl file.

* Updated BackupPC_sendEmail to handle language-specific email messages.

* Allow client (host) names to contain spaces.  Spaces in host names
  need to be escaped via "\" in the hosts file.  The user of spaces in
  host names is discouraged, but they should work.  One feature that
  doesn't work with host names that contain spaces is the highlighting
  of that name in the log file display in the CGI interface.  There are
  no plans to fix this.

* Renamed $Conf{SmbClientTimeout} to $Conf{ClientTimeout}.

* Fixed all open() calls to use 3 argument form to fix handling of file
  names with trailing whitespace.  Also fixed CGI interface so these
  file names are displayed correctly.

* Fixed new 2.0.0 CGI navigation bug that causes the top-level directory
  to have a URL "&share=//boot&dir=" instead of "&share=/boot&dir=/".
  Reported by Pascal Schelcher.  Fixed similar problem reported by
  Doug Lytle.

* Added "PerlTaintCheck On" to the mod_perl section in the docs,
  suggested by Tim Demarest.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 1.5.0, 2 Aug 2002
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changed conf/config.pl so that $Conf{TarIncrArgs} uses the --newer
  option instead of --newer-mtime.  Also removed --atime-preserve from
  $Conf{TarClientCmd}.  This makes the default settings work better
  with tripwire.

* Fixed configure.pl so it correctly detects a running BackupPC <= v1.4.0
  so it can correctly warn the user to stop it before upgrading.  Reported
  by David Holland.

* Added missing ";" to entity escape in EscapeHTML in BackupPC_Admin.
  Reported by Guillaume Filion.

* Added LDAP setup to documentation from David Holland.

* Tar.pm now adds a "." to file paths that start with "/", so that all
  tar paths are relative.  From Ludovic Drolez.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 1.5.0beta0, 30 Jun 2002
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* A full set of restore options is now supported, including direct
  restore via smbclient or tar or downloading a zip or tar file.

* Major additions to CGI script to support better directory navigation,
  restore features and mod_perl.  Also, file downloads from the CGI
  interface now correctly preserve the file name and provide the
  correct Content-Type for the most common types of files.  Improved
  directory navigation was contributed by Ryan Kucera.

* New script BackupPC_zipCreate (contributed by Guillaume Filion) is the
  zip analog of BackupPC_tarCreate.  BackupPC_zipCreate can be used to
  create a zip archive of any portion of a backup.

* Substantial additions to BackupPC_tarCreate to support restore,
  including modifying path names, handling hardlinks, fixing
  support of old backups without attributes (pre-v1.4.0).  Plus
  BackupPC_tarCreate is now an offical part of the release.
  (Lack of support for hardlinks was reported by John Stanley.)

* BackupPC_tarExtract now supports hardlinks and fixed pooling of
  attribute files.

* A unix domain socket is now used for communication between the CGI
  interface and BackupPC.  The original TCP socket is optional.  Sockets
  are correctly re-initialized if config.pl is updated with new socket
  settings.

* For improved security messages over the unix or TCP socket are protected
  via an MD5 digest based on a shared secret, a sequence number, a time
  stamp and a unique per-connection number.

* Additions to configure.pl to support install of directory navigation
  images.

* Fixed case where $Conf{BackupFilesOnly} or $Conf{BackupFilesExclude}
  were set to a single string or list (in v1.4.0 only the case of
  hash worked correctly).  Reported by Phillip Bertolus.

* Fixed case of $Conf{BackoutGoodCnt} == 0.  This setting now makes the
  client always subject to blackout, matching the comments in config.pl.
  Also fixed handling of $Conf{BackoutGoodCnt} < 0 in the CGI script
  reported by Pascal Schelcher.

* Fixed byte and file totals for tar backups, reported by several users.

* Fixed --newer-mtime date/timestamp format to make it ISO 8601 compliant,
  suggested by Erminio Baranzini.

* Fixed handling of $Conf{BackupFilesOnly} in BackupPC::Xfer::Tar.pm, as
  well as shell escaping of tar arguments.

* Fixed entity encoding of 8-bit characters in the CGI interface.

* Added optional CGI headers in $Conf{CgiHeaders} that by default
  is set to a no-cache pragma.  Suggested by Benno Zuure.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 1.4.0, 16 Mar 2002
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BackupPC now supports tar (in addition to smb) for extracting host	
  data.  This is the most convenient option for linux/unix hosts.
  Tar can be configured to run over ssh, rsh or to backup a local
  nfs mount from the host.

* Support for special files, including symbolic links, fifo, character
  and block device files has been added, so that all native linux/unix
  file types can be correctly backed up when using tar transport.
  Special files are all stored as regular files and the type attributes
  are used to remember the original file type.

* All unix file attributes are now saved (and pooled when possible).
  This includes user and group ownership, permissions, and modification
  time.  Smbclient also does a reasonable job of emulating unix 
  permissions (such as mtime), and these attributes get saved too.

* The new default is to not fill incremental dumps.  configure.pl
  automatically sets $Conf{IncrFill} to 0.  The default was 1
  (incrementals were filled with hardlinks).  Since the CGI
  script does filling at browsing time, there is no need to
  fill incremental dumps.

* Backup file names are now stored in "mangled" form. Each node of a
  path is preceded by "f", and special characters (\n, \r, % and /) are
  URI-encoded as "%xx", where xx is the ascii character's hex value. So
  c:/craig/example.txt is now stored as fc/fcraig/fexample.txt. This
  was done mainly so meta-data could be stored alongside the backup
  files without name collisions.  In particular, the attributes for the
  files in a directory are stored in a file called "attrib", and
  mangling avoids file name collisions (I discarded the idea of having
  a duplicate directory tree for every backup just to store the
  attributes). Other meta-data (eg: rsync checksums) could be stored in
  file names preceded by, eg, "c".  There are two other benefits to
  mangling: the share name might contain "/" (eg: "/home/craig" for tar
  transport), and I wanted that represented as a single level in the
  storage tree.  Secondly, as files are written to NewFileList for later
  processing by BackupPC_link, embedded newlines in the file's path
  will cause problems which are avoided by mangling.

  The CGI script undoes the mangling, so it is invisible to the user.
  Of course, old (unmangled) backups are still supported by the CGI
  interface.

* Various changes to the CGI interface, BackupPC_Admin:

  + Added button that allows users to manually start a full dump in
    addition to the existing incremental dump.

  + Added display of file attributes when browsing backups.

  + Added an optional holdoff time specified by the user when canceling
    a backup. BackupPC will not attempt any new backups for at least the
    specified time. This holdoff time can be changed whether or not a
    backup is running.

  + Added supports for file mangling, and correct merging of unfilled
    backups from mangled or unmangled (and compressed or uncompressed)
    fulls when browsing or restoring.

  + Only displays a "Start Incr Backup" button if there are already some
    backups.

  + For DHCP hosts, when a user tries to manually start a backup, add
    a check for the netbios name of both the host the request came
    from (REMOTE_ADDR) and the last known DHCP address for that host
    to see if either address matches the host. If not, an error
    message is display. The previous behavior was that only requests
    from the client itself succeeded, and requests from other machines
    quietly failed.

* Changed the version numbering to X.Y.Z, instead of X.0Y. This release
  is 1.4.0. The first digit is for major new releases, the middle digit
  is for significant feature releases and improvements, and the last
  digit is for bug fixes. You should think of the old 1.00, 1.01, 1.02
  and 1.03 as 1.0.0, ..., 1.3.0.

* BackupPC and the CGI script BackupPC_Admin now check that the effective
  user id is correct to avoid accidentally launching BackupPC as the
  wrong user or detecting CGI configuration problems.  This behavior
  can be turned off using the $Conf{BackupPCUserVerify} option.

* In numerous places changed "Smb" to "Xfer" (eg: log file names) to
  support generic names for both smb and tar transport methods.  The
  CGI script checks for old names for backward compatibility.

* Major changed to Backup_dump to support new tar transport.  All transport
  specific code moved into BackupPC::Xfer::Smb and BackupPC::Xfer::Tar
  objects.

* Added workaround for a bug in Samba's smbclient for files between 2GB
  and 4GB.  The file size in the tar header is incorrect.  This allows
  files up to 4GB to work with smbclient, rather than 2GB.  To support
  files larger than 2GB you must make sure perl is compiled with the
  uselargefiles option (use "perl -V | egrep largefiles" to check) and
  the pool directory must be on a file system that supports large files.

* Moved the pool writing code into a module BackupPC::PoolWrite.  This
  allows the clever file pool checking (digest, uncompressing, comparing
  etc with minimum disk IO) to be used easily in multiple places (eg: it
  is now used for writing attribute files so they can be pooled).

* Changed MD5 to Digest::MD5 to avoid use of the depreceated MD5 module.

* Shortened default $Conf{MyPath} so that perl's taint mode is more likely
  to be happy.  The old $Conf{MyPath} contained /usr/local/bin, which
  on one user's machine was world writable and perl -T correctly
  complained about it.

* Fixed ping command options in Lib.pm so that it works on OpenBSD.
  Thanks to Kyle Amon for sending the fix.  Decided to move the
  ping options from Lib.pm into config.pl (as $Conf{PingArgs}) and
  now configure.pl tries to come up with a sensible default based on
  the OS.

* Fixed argument checking in BackupPC_tarExtract to allow '$' in the
  share name (eg: C$).  Thanks to Jules Agee for this fix.  Also
  changed the default config.pl so that single quotes are used
  everywhere so that people don't get tripped up putting '$' inside
  double-quoted strings.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 1.03, 9 Dec 2001
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BackupPC now has full support for compression.  There are now two
  pool areas, the original pool for uncompressed files, and cpool for
  compressed files. The compression is done by Compress::Zlib.
  Compression reduces the pool disk usage by around 40%, although your
  mileage may vary.  Compression is optional and can also be specified on
  a per-PC basis (although this will cost more pool storage since many
  backup files will have to be stored in both compressed and
  uncompressed forms.

* A new script, BackupPC_compressPool, can be run to compress the entire
  pool.  This is used once to migrate all the pool data from uncompressed
  to compressed on existing installations.  Read the documentation
  (Installing BackupPC/Compressing an existing pool) before running
  BackupPC_compressPool!

  Alternatively, compression can simply be turned on and all new backups
  will be compressed. Both old (uncompressed) and new (compressed)
  backups can be browsed and viewed. Eventually, the old backups will
  expire and all the pool data will be compressed.  However, until the
  old backups expire, this approach could require 60% or more additional
  pool storage space to store both uncompressed and compressed versions
  of the backup files.

* Significant improvements to the cgi interface, BackupPC_Admin:

    - much better layout navigation
    - handles compressed backup files and compressed log files
    - handles unfilled incremental dumps
    - better backup directory browsing navigation
    - reports compression statistics
    - $Conf{CgiDateFormatMMDD} allows you to set date format (MM/DD or DD/MM)
    - Additional customization with $Conf{CgiHeaderFontType},
      $Conf{CgiHeaderFontSize}, $Conf{CgiNavBarBgColor}, and
      $Conf{CgiHeaderBgColor}.

* Eliminated BackupPC_queueAll.  BackupPC directly reads the hosts
  file and queues the PCs itself.  Like config.pl, BackupPC will
  re-read the hosts file on each wakeup if its modification time
  changes, or upon a SIGHUP.  This also makes for better behavior
  when adding a host: if you add hosts, simply send a SIGHUP to
  BackupPC or wait for the next wakeup.

* BackupPC_dump now compresses the SmbLOG file if compression is enabled.

* BackupPC_dump keeps track of compressed file sizes so that compression
  statistics can be reported by the cgi interface.

* Aging of old log files now handles compressed log files (.z extension).

* Added configuration option $Conf{IncrFill} to specify whether
  incremental dumps should be filled in.  Old behavior was that
  filling was on.  Now it's optional.  See config.pl for more
  details.

* BackupPC_nightly now cleans and generates statistics for both
  the uncompressed pool and compressed pool (cpool).

* Added new utility script BackupPC_zcat that can be used to
  uncompresses BackupPC files.

* configure.pl offers various options related to compression,
  depending upon whether this is a new install or upgrade,
  and whether or not Compress::Zlib is installed.

* configure.pl now makes a backup copy of config.pl before
  config.pl is updated.

* added three new fields to the backups file to handle optional
  filling and compression stats.

* Added -e option to BackupPC_dump.  BackupPC now invokes BackupPC_dump -e
  on each dhcp host once each night to verify that very old backups are
  expired.  This ensures that very old backups are expired even if
  the dhcp host has not been on the network for a long time.

* fixed bug in BackupPC::FileZIO.pm that required Compress::Zlib,
  even if compression was off.  Thanks to Steve Holmes for reporting
  this.

* fixed bug that caused a BackupPC queue to get blocked when a backup
  cancel attempt was made during the BackupPC_link phase.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 1.02, 28 Oct 2001.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added new script BackupPC_tarExtract to extract the smbclient tar
  archive. This reduces disk writes by perhaps 90-95% and disk reads by
  50%. Previously, tar was used to extract and write everything to disk.
  Then BackupPC_dump would read enough of each file to compute the MD5
  digest, and then compare the full file with candidate pool files.  So
  for each 1MB file that matches a single file in the pool, there would
  be 1MB of disk writes and 2MB of disk reads (to compare two 1MB files).

  BackupPC_tarExtract instead extracts the archive using a 1MB memory
  buffer.  This allows the MD5 digest to be computed without touching the
  disk.  Next, any potential pool file compares are done by comparing the
  pool file against the incoming tar data in memory, which only requires
  the pool file to be read.  So for each 1MB file that matches a single
  file in the pool, there are now no disk writes, and only 1MB of reads.
  BackupPC_tarExtract handles arbitrary size files and repeated
  potential pool matches.  If the incoming file doesn't match the pool
  then it is written to disk (once the pool is mature this happens maybe
  5-10% of the time).

* Substantial changes to BackupPC_dump:

    + BackupPC_tarExtract is now used in place of tar.

    + BackupPC_dump now reads the output from both smbclient and
      BackupPC_tarExtract and merges them into SmbLOG.

    + Named pipes are no longer used to connect smbclient to tar
      (now BackupPC_tarExtract).  Regular pipes are used instead.
      This avoids the need to system mknod or mkfifo.

    + Locked files on the client that can't be read by smbclient
      previously were filled with 0x0 bytes by smbclient, meaning
      tar extracted a useless file filled with 0x0 bytes.  Now,
      BackupPC_dump watches the output of smbclient and removes
      any files that smbclient couldn't read.  This avoids storing
      useless files.  It tries to replace such files with a hard link
      to a previous dump.  These actions appear in the log file.

* added new module lib/BackupPC/FileZIO.pm. This handles pool file
  I/O and is used by BackupPC_tarExtract.  BackupPC::FileIO supports
  reading and writing compressed and regular files and provides all the
  hooks for compression support in BackupPC (should be supported in next
  version). BackupPC::FileIO also does efficient writing of files that
  contain leading 0x0 bytes (by seeking past the 0x0 bytes). This is
  helpful when smbclient reads a locked file, and it fills the tar
  output with a file of the correct size but all 0x0.  Such files will be
  later removed by BackupPC_dump.  But in the meantime, BackupPC::FileIO
  writes such files efficiently (as sparse files), meaning just a few
  blocks of disk space will be needed even if the file is large.

* alive/dead counting for blackout now works correctly for DHCP hosts.

* BackupPC resets activeJob on startup, to fix bug when BackupPC was
  killed and restarted with backups running.

* added extra non blocking select() in BackupPC to make sure the socket
  reads don't block.

* BackupPC avoids queuing multiple BackupPC_queueAll's on the CmdQueue.

* Updated BackupPC_sendEmail to correctly parse the locked file
  error from 2.2.1a smbclient, so that missing Outlook file emails
  can be correctly sent.

* Changed HostInfoRead() in lib/BackupPC/Lib.pm to lowercase the
  hostname read from the hosts file.

* BackupPC_Admin provides general summary when the host name is empty.

* configure.pl (and BackupPC) now requires perl 5.6.0 or later.

* configure.pl complains if BackupPC is already running, reminding you
  to stop it before upgrading.

* updated documentation, and fixed auto-insertion of config.pl into
  BackupPC.pod (previously the last config parameter was left out of
  BackupPC.pod).

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 1.01, 30 Sep 2001
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Documentation cleanup in README, doc/BackupPC.pod, conf/config.pl.

* BackupPC_sendMail now reads the optional per-PC config file, allowing
  email configuration parameters to be set on a per-PC basis.

* Removed the unused 4096-length MD5 digest code in lib/BackupPC/Lib.pm.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 1.00, 21 Sep 2001
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Initial release of BackupPC on sourceforge.net.
