#
# BackupPC_serverMesg: Send one or more commands to the BackupPC server.
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   As of v1.5.0 the BackupPC server communicates via a unix or internet
#   domain socket.  Every message is protected with an MD5 digest, based
#   on a shared secret, a sequence number, and a per-connection unique
#   key.  This minimizes the risk of an attacked issuing fake commands
#   to the BackupPC server.
#
#   Previously, telnet could be used to talk to the BackupPC server.
#   As of v1.5.0 that is no longer possible.
#
#   This script replaces telnet as a mechanism for sending BackupPC
#   messages.  Usage:
#
#       BackupPC_serverMesg mesg
#
#   Example:
#       BackupPC_serverMesg status info
