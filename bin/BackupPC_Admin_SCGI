# BackupPC_Admin_SCGI: An SCGI implementation of the BackupPC
#                      admin interface.
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   BackupPC_Admin_SCGI runs as the BackupPC user, and spawns one
#   or more children to hangle requests from apache.  Apache needs
#   the mod_scgi plugin, and communicates with BackupPC_Admin_SCGI
#   over a designated TCP port.
#
#   IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING: the scgi protocol doesn't support any
#   mutual authentication between apache and BackupPC_Admin_SCGI
#   (ie: the SCGI server).  Since apache handles access control,
#   the SCGI server assumes that every request is valid.
#
#   So *anyone* who can connect TCP port $Conf{SCGIServerPort} that
#   BackupPC_Admin_SCGI is listening on has full access to all the
#   BackupPC backups by spoofing SCGI requests.  So if you use
#   BackupPC_Admin_SCGI, you must block the $Conf{SCGIServerPort}
#   TCP port from any remote machines, and only allow trusted users
#   to access the machine that BackupPC_Admin_SCGI is running on.
#
#   BackupPC_Admin_SCGI should refuse connections from non-localhost
#   machines, but it is still recommended you configure your BackupPC
#   host to block port $Conf{SCGIServerPort}.

#
#  - Bytes 1..$MaxChild are locked by each child to indicate they are idle
#    (which generally means they are blocking on locking byte #0).
#
#  - Byte #0 is used to serialize the child's accepts().  Each child tries to lock

#    returns, it unlocks byte #0, and also unlocks byte #child to indicate it is

#    all the children are busy, so it forks a new child.
