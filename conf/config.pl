#
# Configuration file for BackupPC.
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This is the main configuration file for BackupPC.
#
#   This file must be valid perl source, so make sure the punctuation,
#   quotes, and other syntax are valid.
#
#   This file is read by BackupPC at startup, when a HUP (-1) signal
#   is sent to BackupPC and also at each wakeup time whenever the
#   modification time of this file changes.
#
#   The configuration parameters are divided into four general groups.
#   The first group (general server configuration) provides general
#   configuration for BackupPC.  The next two groups describe what
#   to backup, when to do it, and how long to keep it.  The fourth
#   group are settings for the CGI http interface.
#
#   Configuration settings can also be specified on a per-PC basis.
#   Simply put the relevant settings in a config.pl file in the
#   PC's backup directory (ie: in __TOPDIR__/pc/hostName).
#   All configuration settings in the second, third and fourth
#   groups can be overridden by the per-PC config.pl file.

#
# Host name on which the BackupPC server is running.
#
$Conf{ServerHost} = '';

#
# TCP port number on which the BackupPC server listens for and accepts
# connections.  Normally this should be disabled (set to -1).  The TCP
# port is only needed if apache runs on a different machine from BackupPC.
# In that case, set this to any spare port number over 1024 (eg: 2359).
# If you enable the TCP port, make sure you set $Conf{ServerMesgSecret}
# too!
#
$Conf{ServerPort} = -1;

#
# Shared secret to make the TCP port secure.  Set this to a hard to guess
# string if you enable the TCP port (ie: $Conf{ServerPort} > 0).
#
# To avoid possible attacks via the TCP socket interface, every client
# message is protected by an MD5 digest. The MD5 digest includes four
# items:
#   - a seed that is sent to the client when the connection opens
#   - a sequence number that increments for each message
#   - a shared secret that is stored in $Conf{ServerMesgSecret}
#   - the message itself.
#
# The message is sent in plain text preceded by the MD5 digest.  A
# snooper can see the plain-text seed sent by BackupPC and plain-text
# message from the client, but cannot construct a valid MD5 digest since
# the secret $Conf{ServerMesgSecret} is unknown.  A replay attack is
# not possible since the seed changes on a per-connection and
# per-message basis.
#

# Times at which we wake up, check all the PCs, and schedule necessary
# backups.  Times are measured in hours since midnight.  Can be
# fractional if necessary (eg: 4.25 means 4:15am).
#
# If the hosts you are backing up are always connected to the network
# you might have only one or two wakeups each night.  This will keep
# the backup activity after hours.  On the other hand, if you are backing
# up laptops that are only intermittently connected to the network you
# will want to have frequent wakeups (eg: hourly) to maximize the chance
# that each laptop is backed up.
#
# Examples:
#     $Conf{WakeupSchedule} = [22.5];         # once per day at 10:30 pm.
#     $Conf{WakeupSchedule} = [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22];  # every 2 hours

# The first entry of $Conf{WakeupSchedule} is when BackupPC_nightly is run.
# You might want to re-arrange the entries in $Conf{WakeupSchedule}

#
# Each night, at the first wakeup listed in $Conf{WakeupSchedule},

# in the pool, ie: files that only have one link.  To avoid race
# conditions, BackupPC_nightly and BackupPC_link cannot run at
# the same time.  Starting in v3.0.0, BackupPC_nightly can run
# concurrently with backups (BackupPC_dump).
#
# So to reduce the elapsed time, you might want to increase this
# setting to run several BackupPC_nightly processes in parallel
# (eg: 4, or even 8).

#
# How many days (runs) it takes BackupPC_nightly to traverse the
# entire pool.  Normally this is 1, which means every night it runs,
# it does traverse the entire pool removing unused pool files.
#
# Other valid values are 2, 4, 8, 16.  This causes BackupPC_nightly to
# traverse 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 or 1/16th of the pool each night, meaning it
# takes 2, 4, 8 or 16 days to completely traverse the pool.  The
# advantage is that each night the running time of BackupPC_nightly
# is reduced roughly in proportion, since the total job is split
# over multiple days.  The disadvantage is that unused pool files
# take longer to get deleted, which will slightly increase disk
# usage.
#
# Note that even when $Conf{BackupPCNightlyPeriod} > 1, BackupPC_nightly
# still runs every night.  It just does less work each time it runs.
#
# Examples:
#
#    $Conf{BackupPCNightlyPeriod} = 1;   # entire pool is checked every night
#
#    $Conf{BackupPCNightlyPeriod} = 2;   # two days to complete pool check
#                                        # (different half each night)

# The total size of the files in the new V4 pool is updated every
# night when BackupPC_nightly runs BackupPC_refCountUpdate.  Instead
# of adding up the size of every pool file, it just updates the pool
# size total when files are added to or removed from the pool. 
#
# To make sure these cumulative pool file sizes stay accurate, we
# recompute the V4 pool size for a portion of the pool each night
# from scratch, ie: by checking every file in that portion of the
# pool.
#
# $Conf{PoolSizeNightlyUpdatePeriod} sets how many nights it takes
# to completely update the V4 pool size.  It can be set to:
#   0:  never do a full refresh; simply maintain the cumulative sizes
#       when files are added or deleted (fastest option)
#   1:  recompute all  the V4 pool size every night (slowest option)
#   2:  recompute 1/2  the V4 pool size every night
#   4:  recompute 1/4  the V4 pool size every night
#   8:  recompute 1/8  the V4 pool size every night
#   16: recompute 1/16 the V4 pool size every night
#       (2nd fastest option; ensures the pool files sizes

#
# In V4+, full/incremental backups are decoupled from whether the stored
# backup is filled/unfilled.
#
# To mimic V3 behaviour, if $Conf{FillCycle} is set to zero then fill/unfilled
# will continue to match full/incremental: full backups will remained filled,
# and incremental backups will be unfilled.  (However, the most recent
# backup is always filled, whether it is full or incremental.)  This is
# the recommended setting to keep things simple: since the backup expiry
# is actually done based on filled/unfilled (not full/incremental), keeping
# them synched makes it easier to understand the expiry settings.
#
# If you plan to do incremental-only backups (ie: set FullPeriod to a very
# large value), then you should set $Conf{FillCycle} to how often you
# want a stored backup to be filled.  For example, if $Conf{FillCycle} is
# set to 7, then every 7th backup will be filled (whether or not the
# corresponding backup was a full or not).
#
# There are two reasons you will want a non-zero $Conf{FillCycle} setting
# when you are only doing incrementals:
#
#   - a filled backup is a starting point for merging deltas when you restore
#     or view backups.  So having periodic filled backups makes it more
#     efficient to view or restore older backups.
#
#   - more importantly, in V4+, deleting backups is done based on Fill/Unfilled,
#     not whether the original backup was full/incremental.  If there aren't any
#     filled backups (other than the most recent), then the $Conf{FullKeepCnt}
#     and related settings won't have any effect.
#
$Conf{FillCycle} = 0;

#
# Number of filled backups to keep.  Must be >= 1.
#
# The most recent backup (which is always filled) doesn't count when
# checking $Conf{FullKeepCnt}.  So if you specify $Conf{FullKeepCnt} = 1
# then that means keep one full backup in addition to the most recent
# backup (which might be a filled incr or full).
#
# Note: Starting in V4+, deleting backups is done based on Fill/Unfilled,
# not whether the original backup was full/incremental. For backward
# compatibility, these parameters continue to be called FullKeepCnt, rather
# than FilledKeepCnt.  If $Conf{FillCycle} is 0, then full backups continue
# to be filled, so the terms are interchangeable.  For V3 backups,
# the expiry settings have their original meanings.
#
# In the steady state, each time a full backup completes successfully
# the oldest one is removed.  If this number is decreased, the
# extra old backups will be removed.
#
# Exponential backup expiry is also supported.  This allows you to specify:
#
#   - num fulls to keep at intervals of 1 * $Conf{FillCycle}, followed by
#   - num fulls to keep at intervals of 2 * $Conf{FillCycle},
#   - num fulls to keep at intervals of 4 * $Conf{FillCycle},
#   - num fulls to keep at intervals of 8 * $Conf{FillCycle},
#   - num fulls to keep at intervals of 16 * $Conf{FillCycle},
#
# and so on.  This works by deleting every other full as each expiry
# boundary is crossed.  Note: if $Conf{FillCycle} is 0, then
# $Conf{FullPeriod} is used instead in these calculations.
#
# Exponential expiry is specified using an array for $Conf{FullKeepCnt}:
#
#   $Conf{FullKeepCnt} = [4, 2, 3];
#
# Entry #n specifies how many fulls to keep at an interval of
# 2^n * $Conf{FillCycle} (ie: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...).
#
# The example above specifies keeping 4 of the most recent full backups
# (1 week interval) two full backups at 2 week intervals, and 3 full
# backups at 4 week intervals, eg:
#
#    full 0 19 weeks old   \
#    full 1 15 weeks old    >---  3 backups at 4 * $Conf{FillCycle}
#    full 2 11 weeks old   / 
#    full 3  7 weeks old   \____  2 backups at 2 * $Conf{FillCycle}
#    full 4  5 weeks old   /
#    full 5  3 weeks old   \
#    full 6  2 weeks old    \___  4 backups at 1 * $Conf{FillCycle}
#    full 7  1 week old     /
#    full 8  current       /
#
# On a given week the spacing might be less than shown as each backup
# ages through each expiry period.  For example, one week later, a
# new full is completed and the oldest is deleted, giving:
#
#    full 0 16 weeks old   \
#    full 1 12 weeks old    >---  3 backups at 4 * $Conf{FillCycle}
#    full 2  8 weeks old   / 
#    full 3  6 weeks old   \____  2 backups at 2 * $Conf{FillCycle}
#    full 4  4 weeks old   /
#    full 5  3 weeks old   \
#    full 6  2 weeks old    \___  4 backups at 1 * $Conf{FillCycle}
#    full 7  1 week old     /
#    full 8  current       /
#
# You can specify 0 as a count (except in the first entry), and the
# array can be as long as you wish.  For example:
#
#   $Conf{FullKeepCnt} = [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 2];
#
# This will keep 10 full dumps, 4 most recent at 1 * $Conf{FillCycle},
# followed by 4 at an interval of 4 * $Conf{FillCycle} (approx 1 month
# apart), and then 2 at an interval of 32 * $Conf{FillCycle} (approx
# 7-8 months apart).
#
# Example: these two settings are equivalent and both keep just

# the X option.  Simple shell wild-cards using "*" or "?" are allowed.
#
# For tar, if the exclude file contains a "/" it is assumed to be anchored

# BackupPC prepends a "." if the exclude file starts with a "/".  Note
# that GNU tar version >= 1.13.7 is required for the exclude option to

# "/proc" to $Conf{BackupFilesExclude} unless you have specified
# --one-file-system in $Conf{TarClientCmd} or --one-file-system in
# $Conf{RsyncArgs}.  Also, for tar, do not use a trailing "/" in
# the directory name: a trailing "/" causes the name to not match
# and the directory will not be excluded.
#
# Users report that for smbclient you should specify a directory
# followed by "/*", eg: "/proc/*", instead of just "/proc".
#
# FTP servers are traversed recursively so excluding directories will
# also exclude its contents.  You can use the wildcard characters "*"

#
# To allow for periodic rebooting of a PC or other brief periods when a
# PC is not on the network, a number of consecutive bad pings is allowed
# before the good ping count is reset. This parameter is

# Note that bad and good pings don't occur with the same interval. If a

# machine to be subject to blackout. On the other hand, if a ping is
# failed, it will be retried roughly every time BackupPC wakes up, eg,
# every one or two hours. So a setting for $Conf{BlackoutBadPingLimit} of
# 3 means that the PC will lose its blackout status after 3-6 hours of
# unavailability.
#
# To disable the blackout feature set $Conf{BlackoutGoodCnt} to a negative
# value.  A value of 0 will make all machines subject to blackout.  But

#
#   - 'archive': host is a special archive host.  Backups are not done.

#
# If the filenames displayed in the browser (eg: accents or special
# characters) don't look right then it is likely you haven't set
# $Conf{ClientCharset} correctly.
#
# If you are using smbclient on a WinXX machine, smbclient will convert

# in which case leave $Conf{ClientCharset} empty since smbclient does
# the right conversion.

# so in this case set $Conf{ClientCharset} to 'cp1252'.
#
# On a linux or unix client, run "locale charmap" to see the client's
# charset.  Set $Conf{ClientCharset} to this value.  A typical value
# for english/US is 'ISO-8859-1'.

#
# Normal users can only access information specific to their host.
# They can start/stop/browse/restore backups.
#
# Administrative users have full access to all hosts, plus overall
# status and log information.
#
# The administrative users are the union of the unix/linux group
# $Conf{CgiAdminUserGroup} and the manual list of users, separated
# by spaces, in $Conf{CgiAdminUsers}. If you don't want a group or
# manual list of users set the corresponding configuration setting
# to undef or an empty string.
#
# If you want every user to have admin privileges (careful!), set
# $Conf{CgiAdminUsers} = '*'.
#
# Examples:
#    $Conf{CgiAdminUserGroup} = 'admin';
#    $Conf{CgiAdminUsers}     = 'craig celia';
#    --> administrative users are the union of group admin, plus

# need to set the same port number in the Apache configuration. Here
# are some typical settings you'll need in Apache's httpd.conf:
#
#    LoadModule scgi_module modules/mod_scgi.so
#    SCGIMount /BackupPC_Admin 127.0.0.1:10268

#
# Important security warning!!  The SCGIServerPort must not be
# accessible by anyone untrusted.  That means you can't allow
# untrusted users access to the BackupPC server, and you should
# block the SCGIServerPort TCP port on the BackupPC server.  If you
