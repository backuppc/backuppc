This directory contains some scripts for auto-starting BackupPC
on boot.

The subdirectory src contains source versions of these scripts (before
various absolute paths have been filled in).

Here are instrcutions for different OSs.  Please submit additions
or improvements to this list!

RedHat Linux:
============

When configure.pl is run, the script linux-backuppc is created. It
should be copied to /etc/init.d/backuppc:

    cp linux-backuppc /etc/init.d/backuppc

After copying it, you can test it by running these commands as root:

    /etc/init.d/backuppc start
    /etc/init.d/backuppc status
    /etc/init.d/backuppc stop

You should then run the following commands as root:

    chkconfig --add backuppc
    chkconfig --level 345 backuppc on
    chkconfig --list backuppc

This will auto-start backuppc at run levels 3, 4 and 5.

Debian Linux:
============

When configure.pl is run, the script debian-backuppc is created.

(Can a Debian user add some instructions here??)

Suse Linux:
==========

When configure.pl is run, the script suse-backuppc is created.

Using Suse 9.0 "chkconfig --level" doesn't work, so you should run:

    chkconfig backuppc 345
    chkconfig --list backuppc

Gentoo Linux:
============

When configure.pl is run, the script gentoo-backuppc and the init conf files
gentoo-backuppc.conf are created. They should be copied to the following
locations:

    cp gentoo-backuppc /etc/init.d/backuppc
    cp gentoo-backuppc.conf /etc/conf.d/backuppc

You can test it by running these commands as root:

    /etc/init.d/backuppc start
    /etc/init.d/backuppc status
    /etc/init.d/backuppc stop

After copying these files, run the following  as root to make BackupPC to
start automatically at boot (at the default run level):

    rc-update add backuppc default

Slackware:
=========

When configure.pl is run, the script slackware-backuppc is created.

Install it by running these commands as root:

    cp slackware-backuppc /etc/rc.d/rc.backuppc
    chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/rc.backuppc

then use an editor to add /etc/rc.d/rc.backuppc to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

Solaris:
=======

When configure.pl is run the shell script solaris-backuppc is created.
This should be copied to /etc/init.d and links made in /etc/rc3.d
and /etc/rc0.d.

    cp solaris-backuppc /etc/init.d/backuppc
    ln -s /etc/init.d/backuppc /etc/rc3.d/S85backuppc
    ln -s /etc/init.d/backuppc /etc/rc0.d/K85backuppc

This will auto-start backuppc at run level 3 and stop it at run level 0.

(Can a Solaris user please tell me if these instructions are correct?)
